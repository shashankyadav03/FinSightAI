I'm a researcher with a PhD in NLP who trains LLMs from scratch for a living and often find myself in need of communicating the process in a way that's digestible to a broad audience without back and forth question answering, so I'm thrilled to have found your piece! As an aside, I think the token order on the y-axis of the attention mask for decoders on slide 10 is reversed \\n[/INST]\\nThanks Sean! It's always a challenge to convey technical information in a way that both the researcher and general  audience can get value from. So your approval means a lot :) Thanks for pointing the out.
